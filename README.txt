I updated the SRS with some stuffs, feel free to take a look. It's basically done, though we may need to update Use Cases with additional functionality, but that won't be hard.

I included Nonfunctional Requirements that we will have a seizure warning on the screen before gameplay, as well as some sort of copyright thing, and some verbiage about coding style standards. I can take care of this for next week.
