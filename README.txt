I removed a few use cases, as they didn't seem large enough to necessitate an entire use case.

For example, Timer didn't seem like it had enough steps to be a use case. It would be maybe two steps.

I turned on the change tracking in the SRS document just to keep track of what's changed and who's changed what. Anything highlighted were things I wasn't sure about.

Use cases should be just about done, unless we add functionality. Feel free to make comments/changes/do whatever.
